# Platform Roadmap

## Theme: Fastest Dev to Prod (Developer Productivity)

This roadmap outlines the key initiatives focusing on enabling developers to move efficiently from development to production with enterprise-grade AI capabilities.

## 1. Built-in File Tool
- **Integrated Vector Database** - Built-in storage for embeddings.
- **Bring Your OWn Vector Database** - Bring your favorite or existing vector database.
- **Document Processing Pipeline** - Tools to ingest and process documents.
- **Built-in File Search Tool** - File search tool executes within OpenResponses API.


## 2. API Playground
- **Model Configuration** - Configure your own model.
- **Use Built-in tools** - Built in tools are supported by default.
- **External tools** - Use any external tool for simulation.
- **Even Traces** - Gives complete transparency of model executions, tool executions with input and output.

## 2. OpenEvals API
- **Open Implementation** - Open implementation of OpenAI eval API [specifications](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/evals)
- **Eval With Your OWn Model** - Eval with your cost efficient small model or fine tuned model.
- **Completely Connected Eval Cycle** - Out of the box connected eval with Agent building.
- **Native Support** - Native support to Responses and ChatCompletions API.

## 3. A/B Testing
- **A/B Test Models** - Compare different models.
- **Statistical Analysis** - Measure impact of changes with confidence intervals.
- **Performance Comparison** - Side-by-side metrics for different configurations.

## 4. Built-In Browser Tool
- **Bring Your Own Browser Tool** - Bring your own tool for to operate on computer like Computer use, browser use, operator, etc
- **Browse With Optimization** - Optimised for faster executions.

## 6. Simulations (KPI Dashboard)
- **Load Testing** - Simulate high traffic scenarios.
- **Scenario Replay** - Re-run production scenarios in test environments.
- **Failure Mode Analysis** - Test system behavior under various error conditions.
- **Performance Projections** - Estimate scaling requirements and costs.
- **Custom KPI Tracking** - Build dashboards for business-specific metrics.

This roadmap will be regularly reviewed and updated based on user feedback, market changes, and technological advancements.
