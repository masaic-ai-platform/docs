# What is OpenResponses

A fully OpenAI-compatible, self-hostable API — enabling developers and enterprises to build and deploy AI applications faster while retaining full control of data, models, and infrastructure.

If it works with OpenAI — agents, SDKs, client libraries, and tools — it works with OpenResponses, without changes.

Self-host to maintain security, compliance, and flexibility in choosing any model while leveraging the full speed and evolving capabilities of the OpenAI ecosystem.

# Get Started in Minutes

## Launch with a Single Docker Command
Whether you're an experienced dev or just exploring AI, OpenResponses makes it dead simple to spin up your own AI environment.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 masaicai/open-responses:latest
```

## Seamless Integration
If you already use the OpenAI SDK, just point your API calls to OpenResponses. Minimal code changes—maximum productivity.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

openai_client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", 
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

response = openai_client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="Tell me a joke"
)
```

### Using with OpenAI Agent SDK
```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from openai.agents import Agent, OpenAIResponsesModel
import os

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", 
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a humorous poet who can write funny poems of 4 lines.",
    model=OpenAIResponsesModel(model="gpt-4o-mini", openai_client=client)
)
```

### Using with cURL
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/responses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "model": "openai@gpt-4o",
    "stream": false,
    "input": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Tell me a joke"
        }
    ]
