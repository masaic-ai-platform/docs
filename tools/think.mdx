description: 'Document reasoning steps and decision-making processes without side effects'
---

The Think tool allows you to log thoughts and reasoning processes without obtaining new information or changing any data, providing a transparent audit trail of decision-making.

## What It Is

The Think tool is a simple utility that documents reasoning or decision-making processes without changing state or having side effects. It's particularly useful when you want to explicitly record the rationale behind decisions.

## Configuration

The Think tool requires a single parameter:

<CodeGroup>
```json Basic Configuration
{
  "thought": "Your thought goes here"
}
```

```json Example Usage
{
  "thought": "I need to first consider the user's budget constraints before recommending high-end solutions"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Response Format

The Think tool returns a simple acknowledgment of the recorded thought:

```json
{
  "thought": "I need to first consider the user's budget constraints before recommending high-end solutions"
}
```

## Example Applications

### Decision Documentation

The Think tool is ideal for creating a clear record of decision rationale:

```json
{
  "thought": "The user's request for a database solution requires evaluating their scale needs. Their expected 10M daily transactions suggests PostgreSQL would be more suitable than SQLite."
}
```

### Analysis Progression

Document the progression of your analysis:

```json
{
  "thought": "After reviewing the error logs, I notice that failures primarily occur during peak traffic hours, suggesting a resource contention issue rather than a code bug."
}
```

### Assumption Recording

Explicitly record assumptions being made:

```json
{
  "thought": "I'm assuming the user is operating in a cloud environment with auto-scaling capabilities based on their mention of AWS in previous messages."
}
```

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Keep Thoughts Concise and Clear">
  Focus on recording the key decision points or reasoning steps without unnecessary details. This makes the audit trail more valuable and easier to follow.
  
  **Good Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "thought": "User's data privacy requirements suggest an on-premises solution would be preferable to cloud hosting."
  }
  ```
  
  **Less Effective**:
  ```json
  {
    "thought": "Thinking about what to recommend. There are many options. Cloud is one option but maybe not best. On-premises could work better perhaps because of data privacy but not sure yet."
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Structured Reasoning">
  When documenting complex reasoning, use a structured format to make your thought process clear.
  
  ```json
  {
    "thought": "Evaluating the recommendation approach: (1) Security requirements: high, (2) Budget constraints: moderate, (3) Timeline: tight. Given these constraints, will prioritize established solutions with good security track records."
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Integrate with Other Tools">
  The Think tool works best when used in conjunction with other tools in a complete workflow.
  
  ```
  1. Use Think to document initial approach
  2. Use File Search to gather information
  3. Use Think again to document how the new information affects the approach
  4. Use Agentic Search for deeper analysis
  5. Use Think to document final reasoning
  ```
</Accordion>

## Integration Examples

### Integration with Agentic Search

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --location 'http://localhost:6644/v1/responses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "model": "openai@gpt-4o",
    "tools": [
      {

        "type": "agentic_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["vs_tech_docs"]
      }
    ],
    "input": "What are the best practices for microservice communication patterns?",
    "instructions": "First document your search strategy using the think tool, then perform the search, and finally document your insights from the search results."
}'
```

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:6644/v1",
    api_key="your_openai_api_key"

            "vector_store_ids": ["vs_tech_docs"]
        }
    ],
    input="What are the best practices for microservice communication patterns?",
    instructions="First document your search strategy using the think tool, then perform the search, and finally document your insights from the search results."
)

print(response)
